# KSP Scripts

You can find all my scripts used for playing KSP in this repository. While learning C++, I thought what would be a better way to learn it thoroughly than learning while doing something you love. Therefore, I set up a KSP C++ Client using kRPC and this repository is its outcome.

## Installation

1. Set up a kRPC C++ client. For setting it up using Visual Studio watch [this video by Saucer Chrome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE8GB1vOLyI).
2. Clone this repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jokyjoe-joy/ksp-scripts
```
